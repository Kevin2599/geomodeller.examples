Mining examples Geomodeller -Readme
The examples presented in this directory represent preliminary
geological investigation work when another mining package is also being used in conjunction
for planning stope shapes and development work.

The example is loosely based upon a realistic scenario around Reed Mine in Canada.
3 proposed stope shapes have been designed in a CAD package, and these volumes
are brought into the Geomodeller context with a view to testing against geological uncertainties
the drilling database and the fault network.
WARNING: this is a demonstrator only of interchange between Geomodeller and CAD.
It is not a full project, nor is there anything resembling a proper mine geology model

CAD files, especially in dxf format, are notoriously diverse in their internal structure.
In this case, we have quadrilateral shapes, not triangles. Geomodeller may or may not successfully handle
a dxf format file, depending upon which variant of the allowable ways to represent shapes,
is being used.

A second example that represent preliminary geological investigation work when another mining package 
is also being used in conjunction for planning stope shapes and development work.

A second example from bulk mining, is based upon the Brockman Syncline, Western Australia. 
The region where a huge amount of Iron Ore mining occurs. 
Very simple methods are shown to demostrate how easy it is to create a regional setting for the geology,
then add the detail of faults and further geology refienments. 
We give some rock properties, that are derived from back analysis of the observed geophysics.
Determining the geology from AEM 2.5D inversion, can also be tied into parts of this region.

The third example comes from South Africa - The Bushveld complex and platinium.
Dykes are important in this area, and we present a variation on Tutorial K, but redone
to boostrap from nothing much to a dyke network in one easy step. This is one of the test sites for
the next generation magnetic gradient tensor observations.
